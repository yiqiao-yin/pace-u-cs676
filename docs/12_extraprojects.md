# Capstone Projects

Please see the following projects.

## Project: Ystar Coaching Platform

### Concept Overview
[Go back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

Ystar* aims to build an AI-powered coaching platform tailored for first-time managers in culturally complex environments like Japan and South Korea. This project focuses on developing real-time chat coaching features using generative AI to deliver personalized and context-aware guidance. This platform provides a customized coaching service by utilizing user-specific information (e.g., company size, team structure, personality test results). Also, it continuously enhances coaching quality by incorporating chat history into the context for more personalized and adaptive interactions. The developers will be responsible for building a chat-based web application, managing backend data, and implementing Generative AI integration to ensure intelligent coaching experiences. This aligns with Ystar*'s mission to provide culturally sensitive, scalable, and affordable coaching solutions.

## Project: Succession AI Platform

### Concept Overview
[Go back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

There are millions of family-owned small & medium enterprises (SMEs). Many of them face a succession problem as the founders are aging but their next generation do not want to take over. It is hard for these SMEs to market themselves to potential buyers as they fall below the size and fee threshold of traditional merger & acquisition (M&A) advisors such as investment banks.

Succession AI is an M&A technology platform that matches sellers and buyers of SMEs. The pre-requisite of our vision is to have a database of seller information and make it easy for such information to be presented in a format that potential buyers wish to see. 

To achieve this, we will simplify the process for an SME seller to market itself. A seller inputs/uploads some unstructured corporate data and the platform will structure the data, apply some market information and generate a ‘teaser’ memorandum (Teaser) with an indicative business valuation that can be shown to potential buyers. This process is intended to be simple, fast and free for the SME seller.

### Skills and Roles Needed
