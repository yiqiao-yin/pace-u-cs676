## Syllabus

### Course Description
This course delves into essential algorithms for data analytics with a computational emphasis. Students will master Python and R to build algorithms and analyze data. Key topics include data reduction (data mapping, data dictionaries, scalable algorithms, big data), data visualization, regression modeling, and cluster analysis. The course also covers predictive analytics techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, time series forecasting, and analyzing streaming data. By the end of the course, students will be proficient in leveraging these algorithms to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.

### Required Materials
- Course notes will be released on the course repo.

### Prerequisites/Corequisites
Prerequisites: Open to Data Science Majors.

### Course Objectives
Successful students will:
1. Develop proficiency in Python and R for data analytics.
2. Implement algorithms for data reduction, including data mapping and data dictionaries.
3. Utilize scalable algorithms to handle big data.
4. Gain insights from data through visualization, regression modeling, and cluster analysis.
5. Apply predictive analytics techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, and time series forecasting.
6. Analyze and interpret streaming data in real-time.

### Course Structure
This course will be conducted in person, allowing for direct interaction and hands-on assistance.

Each session will be divided into two main parts:
1. The lecture portion will last 1 hour, where key concepts and theoretical foundations will be covered.
2. The coding session will follow, lasting approximately 1.5 hours, depending on the content and complexity of the day's material.

A coding component is required for this course. We recommend using Google Colab, which allows students to write and execute Python code in a web-based environment, easily accessible through Google Drive.

#### Assessments
Students must demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

1. **Data Engineering:** Handle, preprocess, and store large datasets efficiently.
2. **Data Visualization:** Create insightful visualizations to communicate data findings.
3. **Basic Machine Learning:** Understand and apply fundamental machine learning algorithms or tools.
4. **Basic API Calls:** Make and utilize API calls to interact with different data services.

### Lecture
The lectures are composed of slides and coding sessions. Both slides and Python notebooks will be used during the lecture. Depending on the material's content, slides and coding sessions may be presented in any order.

The slides and coding materials can be found in the course repo.

### Final Exam and Class Project
The final project will be a group activity with no more than five students per team. Each team will conduct a data science project culminating in a presentation, which will be recorded and evaluated by external judges.

### Grading Policy
The assessments will count toward your grade as follows:

- **30%** of your grade will be determined by homework assignments. There will be 10 homework assignments, and the 2 lowest scores will be dropped.
- **30%** of your grade will be determined by an open-book, open-source midterm exam conducted in person.
- **40%** of your grade will be determined by the final project.

Late submissions for the midterm will incur a deduction of 5 points from the total score (100 points).

### Course Policies

#### During Class
- The class sessions will be open book and open laptop.
- Students are encouraged to use AI tools, including ChatGPT and Copilot, and may build their own chatbot if desired.

#### Attendance Policy
- Attendance will not be recorded.

#### Policies on Incomplete Grades and Late Assignments
- The lowest two homework grades will be dropped.
- There will be no make-up sessions for the midterm and final exams.

#### Academic Integrity and Honesty
Students must comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the Code of Student Conduct.

#### Accommodations for Disabilities
Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. Students must register with the Disability Services Office to take advantage of available accommodations.

Discrimination and harassment of any form are not tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited.

## Course Topics

### Schedule and Weekly Learning Goals

The schedule is tentative and subject to change. The learning goals below should be viewed as the key concepts you should grasp after each week, and also as a study guide before each exam, and at the end of the semester. Each exam will test on the material that was taught up until 1 week prior to the exam (i.e. vorticity will not be tested until exam 2). The applications in the second half of the semester tend to build on the concepts in the first half of the semester though, so it is still important to at least review those concepts throughout the semester. Depending on the school calendar and schedule, the terms "week" and "session" are used interchangeably.
